                "content": "- The time series data reveals that the model's prediction interval needs improvement, as there are 13 instances where the actual value ('y') exceeds the upper threshold ('yhat_upper') and 3 instances where it falls below the lower threshold ('yhat_lower'). This indicates that the model may benefit from adjustments to better capture extreme values.\n- Focusing on the MODEL_INFERENCE sku, we can analyze the performance of the model using three key metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n- MAE, measuring the average magnitude of errors, is 988.84. This implies that, on average, our predictions are off by approximately 988 units.\n- RMSE, which serves as a measure of the standard deviation of the residuals, is 1787.71. This suggests a relatively high level of dispersion in the errors, indicating that the model may struggle with consistency.\n- MSE, capturing the average squared differences between predicted and actual values, is 3195901.5. This value is significantly higher than the MAE, implying that there are some large errors contributing to the overall discrepancy.\n- In terms of future trends, it is essential to address the model's prediction interval and the relatively high error metrics. This could involve refining the model's parameters, employing techniques to better capture extreme values, or incorporating additional features to improve prediction accuracy."
